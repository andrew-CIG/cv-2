As a member of the Production Security team, I focused on securing our cloud environment by:

- **Contributing to [Modron](https://github.com/nianticlabs/modron)'s development**: Improved and added features to our cloud compliance tool (Go, Angular).
- **Auxiliary services**: Developed and maintained auxiliary services to support the security team's operations, such as a company-wide notification system.
- **Automating detections**: Created tools to detect and remediate misconfigured resources in the cloud environment.
- **Performing migrations**: Migrated some of our internal tools to Backstage (React) to streamline processes and centralize the information
- **Education & Reviews**: Provided security suggestions, conducted security reviews, and contributed to design documents and code implementation of different features and products.
- **Code Reviews**: Provided insights and feedback on code related to other teams' projects.
